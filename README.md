In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

### Technologies Used

This is a full stack assignment using:

1. SQLite database
2. Plotly.js
3. Heroku

### Requirements

1. Use SQLite database and Plotly.js to build interactive charts for a dashboard.

2. Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route to display the top 10 samples.

3. Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route to display each sample.

4. Display the sample metadata from the route.

5. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

6. Deploy Flask app to Heroku.
